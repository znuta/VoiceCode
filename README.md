# What is Duba?
Fighting payment fraud and checkout friction is key to banks delivering a safe and convenient digital transfer experience for their customers. Banks uses Duba to seamlessly authenticate consumers and safeguard against transfer fraud.

Duba enables voice recognition as a challenge authentication of the user. In the process where the user tries to carry out a transaction instead of the conventional otp being sent to the use mobile number, the issue with the case of otp is the case where the user phone as be stolen or is in a malicious user hand and or is the malicious user that is carrying out the transaction,

Duba instead make a phone call to the user mobile number, Duba ask the user a security question as a commmand and perform voice recognition to check if it is the actual user of the account that is performing the transaction from the user mobile. 

The security question ask are the security questions from the customer banking account doing onboarding.
